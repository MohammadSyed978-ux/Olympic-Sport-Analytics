# Olympic-Sport-Analytics

This project analyzes historical Olympic Games data to understand performance trends across countries, sports, and events. The analysis focuses on identifying which countries have won the most medals overall, 
as well as which countries dominate specific sports and individual events. In addition, the project explores athlete-level characteristics such as sex, height, 
and weight to better understand participation patterns and physical attributes across different Olympic disciplines.

The project is built using Python and core data science libraries. Pandas and NumPy are used for data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and aggregation to ensure accurate analysis and meaningful insights.
For data visualization, Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create clear charts such as bar charts and pie charts, making it easy to compare medal counts and trends across countries and categories. 
Overall, this project demonstrates practical data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization techniques applied to a real-world sports dataset.
